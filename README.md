# Realtime MVC tasks board (Trello lookalike)

A real-time updating lists/tasks board, used mainly in personal hobby projects. It is made with MVC, Knockout, Bootstrap, SignalR and Asp.NET.

This is an old project that i have not worked on for about 3 years now. Its a small real-time updated board meant to be used for personal hobby projects. Its not complete there is some functionality that is missing, certain things that i thought were kind of not required at the moment. And also the code is a bit old so i am planing on updating the code and giving the project an update both when it comes to the code part and the graphical part. 

# Planed changes when i get around to it:

Localization (currently it is only in Swedish, planing on adding English and German.)

Extending Users so that users can see only the "Boards" that they are assigned to.

Updating all the lib's to their latest versions.

Changing the look of it more towards the metro ui style.

Add user-profiles.

Add files support, so that files can be added both to boards and tasks.

Add logging.
